# 👋 Hi, I’m Satyarth (@SatyWritesCode)  

I'm a **Software Engineer** passionate about building scalable systems, solving complex problems, and crafting clean, efficient code. After working as a Software Engineer for some time, I had an **epiphany**—I realized how much more there is to learn, and that I was falling behind. There’s an ocean of knowledge out there, and I’m here to **catch up, level up, and push my limits** every single day!  

## 🔥 What I’m Focused On:
- 🚀 **Backend Development** – API design, microservices, AWS, and databases  
- 💡 **System Design & Scalability** – Architecting high-performance distributed systems  
- 🧠 **Data Structures & Algorithms** – Sharpening problem-solving for interviews & beyond  


## 🌱 My Learning Journey:
- Deep diving into **system design concepts**  
- Enhancing **algorithmic thinking** through regular problem-solving  
- Exploring **cutting-edge technologies** to stay ahead  

## 🤝 Looking to Collaborate On:
- **Backend-heavy** projects  
- Scalable **full-stack applications**  
- **Innovative ideas** that push boundaries
